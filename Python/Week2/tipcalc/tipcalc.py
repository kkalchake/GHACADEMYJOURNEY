### Get the user inputs
# bill_amount = float(input(('What is the bill amount?))
# tip_percentage = float(input(('What is the tip percentage you wish to add?'))

### Calculate and output
# float total_bill = bill_amount + (bill_amount*tip_percentage)
# print ('The total bill with %{tip_percentage} is %{total_bill}')

### Get the user inputs
# number_of_people = int(input('How many people are splitting the check?'))
# in range of number_of_people:
#     name = input('What is your name?')
#     ordered_for = list(input('Enter coma separated format dollar amounts for each dish you ordered))
# takes bill_amount -> calculates all people's order total and assigns tax_amount
# splits tax_amount + tip_amount
# adds above to sum of each dish ordered
### Output whole math
# Output table with each name and how much each owe
# Output confirmation of right math
